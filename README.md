# Bind-App-o-NordLynx
Basically, a better version of split tunneling for Nord. Why not just use split tunneling? It was leaking traffic when 'paused'. Setting kill switch, makes all traffic wait for nord to connect even when split tunneling is on.... This is a windows firewall rule creator that blocks network traffic to the app if NordLynx is paused. It also allows dir.
